.word value [reps]

labels
------
name:

if a 'main:' label exists, the program will start there
if you want to use a label within the fasm compiler after
declaring it, put a % in front, as it is an immediate address
.word cannot take a label
labels are not supported as full immediates

address modes
-------------
imm. value:		val
imm. address:	%addr
PC-relative:	%offst@
register: 		$nam
reg. indirect:	$num%
scaled:			$nam($ad0[,sf0])
doubly scaled:	$nam($ad0[,sf0])($ad1[,sf1])
autoincrement:	$nam+
autodecrement:	$nam-
scaled disp.:	%addr($ad0[,sf0])
2x scale disp.:	%addr($ad0[,sf0])($ad1[,sf1])

for doubly scaled, the first parenthesis is the displacement from
the operation, the second is displacement from the first
$ad0 is the first displacement
$ad1 is the second displacement
sf is the shift factor

format
------
cmnd    op1, op2, op3
