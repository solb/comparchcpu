CSCI-453-01 Computer Architecture
FabComp: specificatoin addendums

Overview
--------
Both of the specifications for our architecture have been modified sufficiently
to warrant resubmission, so they have been submitted in hard copy form.
However, this document serves to highlight the most important differences
between the documents as originally submitted and as they appear now.

ISA document
------------
The only change to the ISA document is the addition of a new PRNT instruction
for printing the contents of registers and memory locations.  This new operation
is identified by the opcode 0x20, and takes a single argument.

Hardware specification
----------------------
The platform's hardware specification has changed more dramatically to correct
the following problems with its initial content:

Section 1.1
===========
 - Datapath diagram: Added in missing wires between components

Section 1.2
===========
 - Control path components: Corrected mistakes in the word sizes of the
   micro-jump table and the microJBUS
 - Control path diagram: Rerouted some register connections through different
   buses to fix problems with the word sizes

Section 2
=========
 - RTL: Practically rewrote the RTL to address numerous microcode bugs

Section 3.2
===========
 - J-type microinstruction type field: Added missing codes for halting the
   processor normally, halting it due to an error, and printing the contents of
   the first operand, encoding them as 0x6, 0x7, and 0x8, respectively.
